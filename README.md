# Chess Data Analysis - DSA210 Project

## **Project Overview**
In this project, I’ll be diving into chess games and player profiles using data from Lichess. My goal is to explore statistical trends related to player country, rating, game type, and opening choices. I want to uncover patterns like which openings work best at different rating levels, how player profiles relate to different types of games, and what counterplay strategies tend to be the most effective against specific openings.

This project brings together my love for chess and data analysis. Instead of using complex chess engines to calculate winning probabilities, I’ll keep things simple by focusing on fundamental statistics and correlations just enough to spot interesting trends without overcomplicating things.

## **Objectives**

1. **Opening Effectiveness by Rating**
   - Determine which openings perform best for different Elo
   - Identify the most common openings and their win rates 

2. **Player Profile and Game Type Correlation**
   - Analyze player profiles (e.g., country, rating) and their influence on game type (e.g., Blitz, Bullet, Classical).
   - Which specific rating groups prefer different time controls or openings

3. **Counterplay Effectiveness**
   - Study which openings work best at some rating levels
   - Find correlations between openings and their most successful responses 

4. **Applying Data Science Skills**
   - Use data collection, preprocessing, visualization, and statistical analysis

## **Dataset**

To carry out this analysis, I’ll be gathering two types of data from Lichess databases:

### **1. Game Data**
Each game record will include:
- **Game ID**: Unique identifier for each match
- **Player Ratings**: Ratings of both players 
- **Game Type**: Blitz, Bullet, Classical, Rapid ...
- **Opening Name**: Opening used in the game 
- **Game Result**: Win, loss, or draw
- **Moves Played**: Move sequence (may be)
- **Time Control**: Game duration and increment

### **2. Player Profile Data**
Each player's profile will include:
- **Username**: Identifier for players
- **Country**: The player's country
- **Peak Rating**: Highest rating player got in each time control
- **Game Preferences**: Most played game type (e.g., Blitz vs. Bullet)
- **Account Type**: Titled player or a casual player

## **Data Collection Plan**

1. **Extracting Data from Lichess API**
   - Use Lichess API to download game and player data
   - Filter some of the data to keep it simple (time period, rating, country ...)

2. **Ensuring Data Quality**
   - Handle missing values (missing country data, ...)
   - Normalize data formats (convert game times to a common format, ...)

## **Analysis Plan**

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Convert lichess data into structured Data Frames
   - Handle missing or inconsistent values

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - **Opening Popularity by Elo**: Identify which openings are most common in different rating
   - **Win Rate by Opening**: Determine which openings perform best
   - **Player Profile Trends**: Find correlations between player country, rating, and preferred game type.

## **Expected Findings**

By the end of this project, I expect to answer questions such as:
- Which openings perform best at different Elo levels?
- What are the most common counterplays for popular openings?
- Do players from certain countries favor specific openings or game types?
- How do Blitz and Bullet (or any gametpe) players differ in their opening selections?

These insights can be valuable for both me and other players looking to refine their game strategies based on their rating, preferred game type, or other factors I’ll be exploring.

## **Conclusion**
This project aims to uncover meaningful insights from chess games and player profiles by analyzing opening trends, player behaviors, and win probabilities across different rating levels. Through data visualization and statistical testing, I hope to identify useful strategies that can help chess players improve their game while also applying my data analysis skills to a subject I’m passionate about.

By exploring chess through the data science, I’ll not only deepen my understanding of game patterns but also strengthen my skills in data collection, processing, and statistical evaluation.

I’m excited to see what the data reveals and to deepen my chess knowledge through this analysis.
