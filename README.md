# Chess Data Analysis - DSA210 Project

## **Project Overview**
In this project, I will analyze chess games and player profiles using data collected from Lichess. My goal is to explore statistical trends related to player country, rating, game type, and opening choices. I aim to identify patterns such as which openings are more effective at different rating levels, how player profiles correlate with game types, and what counterplay strategies work best against certain openings.

This project combines my passion for chess and data analysis. While advanced chess engines can calculate probabilities for winning, I will keep the analysis simple by focusing on fundamental statistics and correlations.

## **Objectives**

1. **Opening Effectiveness by Rating**
   - Determine which openings perform best in different Elo ranges.
   - Identify the most common openings and their win rates across rating categories.

2. **Player Profile and Game Type Correlation**
   - Analyze if player profiles (e.g., country, rating) influence their preferred game type (e.g., Blitz, Bullet, Classical).
   - Investigate whether specific rating groups prefer particular time controls or openings.

3. **Counterplay Effectiveness**
   - Study which openings work best at different rating levels.
   - Find correlations between openings and their most successful responses at various levels.

4. **Applying Data Science Skills**
   - Utilize data collection, preprocessing, visualization, and statistical analysis to extract meaningful insights.

To enhance the analysis, I will also explore additional relationships, such as:
- The impact of a player's average game length on their preferred openings.
- Whether higher-rated players tend to use more aggressive or defensive openings.
- Correlation between a player's Blitz performance and their Classical rating.
- How frequently titled players repeat the same openings compared to non-titled players.
- The effect of playing White vs. Black on opening success rates.

## **Dataset**

To conduct this analysis, I will collect two main types of data from Lichess:

### **1. Game Data**
Each game record will include:
- **Game ID**: Unique identifier for each match
- **Player Ratings**: Ratings of both players at the time of the game
- **Game Type**: Blitz, Bullet, Classical, Rapid
- **Opening Name**: Opening used in the game 
- **Game Result**: Win, loss, or draw
- **Moves Played**: Move sequence (optional, for advanced analysis)
- **Time Control**: Game duration and increment

### **2. Player Profile Data**
Each player's profile will include:
- **Username**: Identifier for players
- **Country**: If available, the player's country
- **Peak Rating**: Highest rating achieved in each time control
- **Game Preferences**: Most played game type (e.g., Blitz vs. Bullet)
- **Account Type**: Whether the player is a titled player or a casual player

These datasets will be merged for deeper insights into how player characteristics influence game outcomes and strategies.

## **Data Collection Plan**

1. **Extracting Data from Lichess API**
   - Use Lichess API to fetch game and player data.
   - Filter data to exclude games with disconnections or incomplete information.
   - Filter some of the data when needed to keep it simple (time period, rating, country)

2. **Ensuring Data Quality**
   - Handle missing values (e.g., missing country data).
   - Normalize data formats (e.g., convert game times to a common format).

3. **Bias Handling Strategies**
   - **Sampling**: Ensure a balanced dataset by collecting games across different Elo levels.
   - **Filtering**: Remove outliers such as intended quick resignations or draws.

## **Tools and Technologies**

- **Python**: For data processing and analysis
- **Pandas**: To clean, manipulate, and merge datasets
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization
- **Scikit-Learn**: For statistical analysis and predictive modeling
- **CSV Storage**: For efficient dataset handling

---

## **Analysis Plan**

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Convert raw API data into structured DataFrames.
   - Handle missing or inconsistent values.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - **Opening Popularity by Elo**: Identify which openings are most common in different rating brackets.
   - **Win Rate by Opening**: Determine which openings perform best and which are most countered.
   - **Player Profile Trends**: Find correlations between player country, rating, and preferred game type.

---

## **Expected Findings**

By the end of this project, I expect to answer questions such as:
- Which openings perform best at different Elo levels?
- What are the most common counterplays for popular openings?
- Do players from certain countries favor specific openings or game types?
- How do Blitz and Bullet players differ in their opening selections?

These insights can provide valuable information for me and players who looking to optimize their game strategies based on their rating and preferred game type.

## **Conclusion**
This project aims to uncover meaningful insights from chess games and player profiles by analyzing opening trends, player behaviors, and win probabilities across rating levels. Through data visualization and statistical testing, I hope to provide useful strategies for chess players while applying my data analysis skills to a subject I am passionate about.

By leveraging data science techniques, I will gain a deeper understanding of chess patterns while also developing skills in data collection, processing, and statistical evaluation.

I look forward to seeing what the data reveals and improving my chess knowledge through this analysis.
